    <h1>What is BMI?</h1>
    <p>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a standardized method used to estimate the amount of body fat a person has in relation to their weight and height. It's a number calculated from a person's weight and height, and is a reliable indicator of body fatness for most people.</p>
    <p>BMI is used as a screening tool to identify possible weight problems for adults. However, BMI is not a diagnostic tool. To determine if excess weight is a health risk, a healthcare provider would need to perform further assessments.</p>
    <p>Here's what the BMI ranges indicate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5</li>
      <li>Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9</li>
      <li>Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9</li>
      <li>Obesity: BMI is 30 or more</li>
    </ul>
